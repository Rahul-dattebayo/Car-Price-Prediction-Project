# Car-Price-Prediction-Project
Our clients who have branched out from Cars24 firm have collaborated with us to provide them with a model which can predict the cars prices for the Covid-19 hit market.

The pandemic situation has changed the course of Automobile business upside-down. With the change in market due to covid 19 impact, our client is facing problems
with their previous car price valuation machine learning models. So, they are looking for new machine learning
